# Earnings-Call-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-and-TS-Forecasting
Using publicly available earnings call transcripts, we attempt to fine-tune pre-trained Masked Language Models using modest hand-annotated datasets, in order to perform sentiment analysis on Executive's utterances. By segmenting those sentiment readings by time and industry, and through the development and application of a proprietary "negative sentiment tripwire", we generate a rich NLP-based feature set upon which to train tree-based &amp; transformer-based classification models for time-series classification and prediction of the next month's S&amp;P500 returns
